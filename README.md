# UAE Population Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project analyzes population trends in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using data from the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center (FCSC). The dataset includes population estimates by gender, age group, and year from 1950 to 2022. The goal of this project is to explore historical population trends and create predictive models to forecast future population growth.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center - UAE Population Estimates](https://opendata.fcsc.gov.ae/@federal-competitiveness-and-statistics-center/uae-population-estimates-by-gender-age-group-year)
- **Description:** The dataset contains population estimates categorized by:
  - **Location:** United Arab Emirates
  - **Age Group:** Various age groups, such as Early Neonatal, Child, Adult, etc.
  - **Gender:** Male and Female
  - **Year:** From 1950 to 2022
  - **Population Value:** The population count for each combination of year, gender, and age group.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into population distribution and growth trends.
2. Develop a time series forecasting model to predict future population values.
3. Explore regression models to predict population sizes based on year, gender, and age group.
4. Visualize key findings and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we explored population trends over time, visualized the distribution by gender and age group, and identified key population growth patterns. Key insights include:
- **Population Growth Trends:** Significant growth in the UAE’s population over the past 70 years, with a notable increase in the male population.
- **Age Group Distribution:** Younger and working-age populations dominate, while elderly populations remain smaller.
- **Gender Distribution:** Males consistently outnumber females in most age groups, reflecting workforce migration trends in the UAE.

### Key Visualizations:
1. **Population Trends Over Time by Gender**
2. **Population Distribution by Age Group and Gender in 2022**
3. **Total Population Distribution by Age Group**

## Predictive Modeling

### 1. Time Series Forecasting:
   - **Model:** ARIMA or SARIMA models are used to predict future population values based on historical trends.
   - **Target:** Population count for each year.
   - **Results:** A forecast of population growth for the next decade.

### 2. Regression Modeling:
   - **Model:** Linear regression or Random Forest is used to predict population count based on features such as year, age group, and gender.
   - **Results:** Prediction of population counts for specific demographics.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.x**
- Install the required libraries:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


### Steps to Run
1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Open the EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook and run the cells to explore the data.
2. Predictive Modeling:
- Run modeling.py to train and evaluate time series and regression models.


## Results and Insights

The time series and regression models developed in this project offer valuable insights into the UAE's demographic trends:
- Population Growth: Strong growth is expected in the male working-age population over the next decade.
- Demographic Shifts: Models highlight potential shifts in age groups, allowing for better policy and urban planning.

## Future Work

- Improved Forecasting: Incorporate external variables (e.g., migration rates, economic conditions) to improve model accuracy.
- Region-Based Analysis: Extend the analysis to specific regions or cities within the UAE.
- Interactive Dashboards: Build interactive dashboards with Power BI or Tableau for real-time data exploration.
