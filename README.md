# UAE Population Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical population trends in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using data from 1950 to 2022. The dataset includes population estimates by gender and age group. The main goals of this project are to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into population growth patterns.
- Build predictive models to forecast future population trends using time series and regression techniques.
- Provide actionable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders in urban planning, economics, and policy-making.

## Dataset

- Source: Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Center - UAE Population Estimates
- Description:
  - Location: United Arab Emirates
  - Age Group: Ranging from Early Neonatal to elderly age groups
  - Gender: Male and Female
  - Year: 1950 to 2022
  - Value: Population count for each year, gender, and age group

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project provides UAE population estimates across several years, categorized by gender and age group. It consists of the following columns:

1. Location Name: The location for all records in this dataset is the UAE.
2. Age Group Name: Population estimates are broken down into different age groups (e.g., Early Neonatal, Child, Adult, Elderly).
3. Sex: Gender of the population (Male or Female).
4. Year: The year for which the population estimate was made, ranging from 1950 to 2022.
5. Value: The population count for the specified year, gender, and age group.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, several insights were uncovered:
- Population Growth: The UAE's population has grown substantially over the decades, especially the male working-age population.
- Gender Distribution: Males consistently outnumber females, likely due to labor migration trends.
- Age Group Distribution: The working-age population dominates, while younger and elderly populations are smaller in comparison.

### Key Visualizations:
1. Population Growth Over Time by Gender
2. Population Distribution by Age Group (2022)
3. Total Population Distribution Across All Years

## Predictive Modeling

### 1. Time Series Forecasting
- Model: ARIMA/SARIMA
- Objective: Forecast population growth over the next decade.
- Results: Accurate population predictions, especially for the working-age male population.

### 2. Regression Modeling
- Model: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Objective: Predict population based on year, age group, and gender.
- Results: Models provide valuable insights into specific demographic trends, useful for policy-making and resource allocation.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Time Series Models: Evaluated using RMSE and MAE.
- Regression Models: Evaluated using R-squared and RMSE.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Steps to Run
1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Open the EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook and run the cells to explore the data.
2. Predictive Modeling:
- Run modeling.py to train and evaluate time series and regression models.

### GitHub Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DataProjectHub/UAE_Population_2015-2021.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd UAE_Population_2015-2021

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Results and Insights

The time series and regression models developed in this project offer valuable insights into the UAE's demographic trends:
- Population Growth: Strong growth is expected in the male working-age population over the next decade.
- Demographic Shifts: Models highlight potential shifts in age groups, allowing for better policy and urban planning.

## Future Work

- Improved Forecasting: Incorporate external variables (e.g., migration rates, economic conditions) to improve model accuracy.
- Region-Based Analysis: Extend the analysis to specific regions or cities within the UAE.
- Interactive Dashboards: Build interactive dashboards with Power BI or Tableau for real-time data exploration.
